# About
The purpose of this new project is to take the existing Eddie middleware for Oniro devices and modify it to improve in flexibility and complexity the selection of services or resources deployed in a network of Linux devices.
In brief the new version of the middleware will be able to:

- running on top of the operating system of the various Linux
devices.

- giving to the applications and services a global view
on a unified pool of virtual resources

- allow the user to compose a request to request specific types of resources
  with constraints on features of these resources through the definition of a DCOP problem. (Distributed constraint optimization)
